2.	How will you make the environment changes applicable to all users? Which script is to be modified?
Ans.    To make permanent changes to the environment variables for all users, 
        go to /etc/skel files, such as . bashrc , and change the ones that are already there or enter the new ones.
        When we create new users, these /etc/skel files will be copied to the new user's home directory.
        environment variables can be modified by using Bash scripts in order to modify the behaviour of the scripts.

3.	I have installed an application named “myapp”. After installation, if I invoke the application, it fails with error as “Command myapp not found”. 
        How will you fix this?
Ans.    Use npx to solve the error "create-react-app: command not found", 
        e.g. npx create-react-app my-app or install the package globally by running npm install -g create-react-app to be able to use the command without the npx prefix.
